# Machine Learning in C

It will not always be exactly what you want. Machine learning is like asking a genie to grant you wishes, if you fucked up a small detail in the description of your wish... the genie is going to fuck you. Machine Learning algorithms are like genies. Run shell script `./build.sh` to generate the object executable files `double` and `gates`.  

### What is Machine Learning?

In imperative and functional programming, you achieve a goal by writing explicit code. In machine learning, you don't write the code that will be executed directly. Instead, you create a model that represents a process you want to predict or optimise. This model has certain parameters, and your code describes your expectations for the model's behaviour.

You provide this untrained model, along with its behavioural description, to a learning process. This process adjusts the parameters until the model aligns well with the given description. The intial description might lead to flawed or unexpected outcomes, but the learning process will modify the model to match the description (with a certain probability), resulting in a model that performs according to the intended behaviour.
